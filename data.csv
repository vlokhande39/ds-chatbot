582,network analytics work,"in network analytics, a software engine analyzes and extracts intelligence from data collected from various sources,such as network devices switches, routers, and wireless, servers sysop, dhp, aaa, configuration database, etc. andtraffic flow details wireless congestion, data speeds, latency, etc.network analytics processes are automated and so are more wide ranging than what can be achieved by manual analysis. "
583,network analytics collect data,"network analytics collects data from a variety of sources, including from servers such as dhp, active directory, radius, dns and sysop, and from network traffic such as netflix, traceroute, and snap. it does so by using techniques such as telemetry and deep packet inspection to build a rich database from which contextual information can be derived."
584,analytics engine,"the analytics engine, the software program that analyzes data and makes decisions, collects data from around the network and performs the desired analysis. this analysis may compare the current state with a model of optimal performance. whenever the program identifies a deviation from optimal, it may suggest remediation or present its findings to a higher levelprogram or to the it staff.the analytics engine may also scrutinized endpoint traffic to help identify the endpoint itself or traffic behavior that may signal malware infection.
"
585,difference cloud local analytics,"networking engineers often debate whether network analytics should be performed remotely, in the cloud, or locally, at the customer premises. placing the analytics engine in the cloud offers access to much more processing power, scale, and communication with other networks. cloud hosted analytics also benefits from up to the minute algorithms and crowd sourced data. "
586,need correlation network engine,"the analytics engine considers the relationship among variables in the network before offering insights or remediation. the correlation among devices, applications, and services can mean that correcting one problem can lead to problems elsewhere.while correlation greatly increases the number of variables in the decision tree and adds complexity to the system, its essential so that all variables can be evaluated for accurate decisions."
587,role decision trees analytic engine,"most analytics engines offer guidance on performance improvement through decision trees. when an analytics engine receives network data indicating super performance, the decision tree calculates the best network device adjustment or configuration to improve performance of that parameter.the decision tree grows based on the number of sources for streaming telemetry and the number of options for optimizing performance in each point. because of the complexity of processing these very large data sets in real time, analytics was previously performed only on supercomputer."
588,network analytics benefit ai ml techniques,"network analytics uses a combination of local and cloud based ai driven analytics engines to make sense of all collected data. using ai and ml, network analytics customized the network baseline for alerts, reducing noise and false positives while enabling it teams to identify issues, trends, anomalies, and root causes accurately. ai,ml techniques along with crowd sourced data are also used to reduce unknowns and improve the level of certainty in decision making."

1088,type dataset used logistic regression,logistic regression is used for binary or multi class classification and the target variable always has to be categorical
1089,logistic regression simple terms,logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome such as yes or no based on prior observations of a data set a logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables
1090,advantage logistic regression,"logistic regression is easier to implement interpret and very efficient to train if the number of observations is lesser than the number of features logistic regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfitting it makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space"
1091,better logistic regression,a neural network is more complex than logistic regression in practice a neural network model for binary classification can be worse than a logistic regression model because neural networks are more difficult to train and are more prone to overfitting than logistic regression
1092,logistic regression use 2 classes,logistic regression cannot be used for classification tasks that have more than two class labels so called multi class classification a logistic regression model that is adapted to learn and predict a multinomial probability distribution is referred to as multinomial logistic regression
1093,difference chi square logistic regression,with chi square contingency analysis the independent variable is dichotomous and the dependent variable is dichotomous logistic regression is a more general analysis however because the independent variable i.e the predictor is not restricted to a dichotomous variable
1094,logistic regression different perception,originally a perception was only referring to neural networks with a step function as the transfer function in that case of course the difference is that the logistic regression uses a logistic function and the perception uses a step function

1112,parameters logistic regression,parameter estimates also called coefficients are the log odds ratio associated with a one unit change of the predictor all other predictor being held constant the unknown model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation
1113,min max scaling,variables that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the model fitting model learned function and might end up creating a bias thus to deal with this potential problem feature wise normalization such as minimal scaling is usually used prior to model fitting
1114,standardize regression,in regression analysis you need to standardize the independent variables when your model contains polynomial terms to model curvature or interaction terms
1115,logic stand,in 1944 joseph person used log of odds and called this function logic abbreviation for logistic unit following the analogy for profit
1116,logistic regression improve accuracy,one of the way to improve accuracy for logistic regression models is by optimizing the prediction probability cutoff scores generated by your logic model
1117,penalty logistic regression,penalized logistic regression imposes a penalty to the logistic model for having too many variables
1118,z score normalized,the z score enables a data administrator to compare two different scores that are from different normal distributions of the data
1119,scale target variable,yes you do need to scale the target variable i will quote this reference a target variable with a large spread of values in turn may result in large error gradient values causing weight values to change dramatically making the learning process unstable
1120,explain need interpret report carry ordinal regression,so more generally this indicates that a scores increase on an independent variable theres an increased probability of falling at a higher level on the dependent
1121,carry ordinal regression using pss statistics,in pss statistics an ordinal regression can be carried out using one of two procedures plum and berlin whilst berlin has a number of advantages over plum including being easier and quicker to carry out it is only available if you have pss statistics advanced module
