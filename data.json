Yes, It is an automated process to extract required information from data by applying machine learning algorithms. \n\n5Ans. Naive Bayes algorithm is a collection of classifiers which works on the principles of the Bayes theorem. This series of NLP model forms a family of algorithms that can be used for a wide range of classification tasks including sentiment prediction, filtering of spam, classifying documents and more.\n\n6Ans. Dependency Parsing, also known as Syntactic parsing in NLP is a process of assigning syntactic structure to a sentence and identifying its dependency parses. This process is crucial to understand the correlations between the head words in the syntactic structure. The process of dependency parsing can be a little complex considering how any sentence can have more than one dependency parses. Multiple parse trees are known as ambiguities. Dependency parsing needs to resolve these ambiguities in order to effectively assign a syntactic structure to a sentence. Dependency parsing can be used in the semantic analysis of a sentence apart from the syntactic structuring\n\n7Ans. Text summarization is the process of shortening a long piece of text with its meaning and effect intact. Text summarization intends to create a summary of any given piece of text and outlines the main points of the document. This technique has improved in recent times and is capable of summarizing volumes of text successfully. Text summarization has proved to a blessing since machines can summarise large volumes of text in no time which would otherwise be really time consuming. There are two types of text summarization\n Extraction based summarization \n Abstraction based summarization\n\n8Ans. NLTK or Natural Language Toolkit is a series of libraries and programs that are used for symbolic and statistical natural language processing.

Bag of Words is a commonly used model that depends on word frequencies or occurrences to train a classifier. This model creates an occurrence matrix for documents or sentences irrespective of its grammatical structure or word order.\n\n11Ans. Pragmatic ambiguity refers to those words which have more than one meaning and their use in any sentence can depend entirely on the context. Pragmatic ambiguity can result in multiple interpretations of the same sentence. More often than not, we come across sentences which have words with multiple meanings, making the sentence open to interpretation. This multiple interpretation causes ambiguity and is known as Pragmatic ambiguity in NLP.\n\n12Ans. Masked language models help learners to understand deep representations in downstream tasks by taking an output from the corrupt input. This model is often used to predict the words to be used in a sentence.\n\n13Ans.

Parts of speech tagging better known as POS tagging refers to the process of identifying specific words in a document and group them as part of speech, based on its context. POS tagging is also known as grammatical tagging since it involves understanding grammatical structures and identifying the respective component. POS tagging is a complicated process since the same word can be different parts of speech depending on the context. The same generic process used for word mapping is quite ineffective for POS tagging because of the same reason.\n\n16Ans.Name entity recognition is more commonly known as NER is the process of identifying specific entities in a text document which are more informative and have a unique context. These often denote places, people, organisations, and more. Even though it seems like these entities are proper nouns, the NER process is far from identifying just the nouns. In fact, NER involves entity chunking or extraction wherein entities are segmented to categorise them under different predefined classes. This step further helps in extracting information.\n\n17Ans. Lemmatization helps to get to the base form of a word, e.g. are playing  play, eating  eat, etc..\n\n18Ans. A technique used in NLP which is used to get a base form of the word.

Common words that occur in sentences that add weight to the sentence are known as \nstop words. These stop words act as a bridge and ensure that sentences are \ngrammatically correct. In simple terms, words that are filtered out before processing \nnatural language data is known as a stop word and it is a common pre processing \nmethod.\n\n35Ans. The process of obtaining the root word from the given word is known as stemming. All \ntokens can be cut down to obtain the root word or the stem with the help of efficient and \nwell generalized rules. It is a rule based process and is well known for its simplicity.\n\n36Ans. There are several factors that make the process of Natural Language Processing \ndifficult. There are hundreds of natural languages all over the world, words can be \nambiguous in their meaning, each natural language has a different script and syntax, \nthe meaning of words can change depending on the context, and so the process of NLP \ncan be difficult.

It is widely used in statistical computations for instance, where it is also known as the standard normal cumulative probability.\n4.The complementary error function represents the area under the two tails of zero mean Gaussian probability density function of variance. The error function gives the probability that the parameter lies outside that range.\n5.Glaisher discovered the Error functions.\n6.Yes, the complementary error function is odd function.\n7.The inverse error function occurs in the solution of nonlinear heat and diffusion problems. It provides exact solutions when the diffusion coefficient is concentration dependent.\n8.The python error function is also known as the gauss error function and this function throws an error, if any non number is passed as a parameter.\n9.The error function at infinity is exactly one.\n10.No, the Error function is not same as Loss function. An error function measures the deviation of an observable value from a prediction, whereas a loss function operates on the error to quantify the negative consequence of an error.\n11.Cost Functions, Loss Functions, Fitted value versus Predicted value, Residual versus Error are the otehr names for Error Functions.\n12.Error is the difference between single actual value and single predicted value. Loss is the average error over training data.\n13.The Error function in neural network is the function, which you try to minimize.\n14.Another classic sigmoid is the error function\n15.Zero is the error function of zero.\n16.stated by Laplace, proved by Jacobi and rediscovered by Ramanujan.\n17.Integrals of the error function occur in a great variety of applications, usually in problems involving multiple integration where the integrand contains exponentials of the squares of the arguments.\n18.The complementary error function represents the area under the two tails of a zero mean.\n19.An integration error refers only to a lead not making it to a third party system.\n20.The most commonly used error function for linear regression is Least Squared Error.\n21.The error handling mechanisms force the application to log the user off and shut down the system.\n22.A Loss function is for single training sample or input. Loss is calculated for every input,number of times of loss calculation will be equal to number of samples present in training dataset. A Cost function is the average loss over the entire training dataset. Cost will be calculate once over entire training dataset.\n23.The other names of Error functions are Cost Functions, Loss Functions, Fitted value versus Predicted value, Residual versus Error.\n24.Residual is the difference between Fitted value and Predicted value in the training dataset.\n25.Error is the difference between Predicted value and Actual value in the test dataset.\n26.A residual is something left over after being used or removed or subtracted.An example of Residual is the paint remaining after all the rooms in the house have been painted. An Error is simply the measure of true difference between actual and predicted values in a machine learning model\n27.Mean Squared Error is the mean or average of squared distances between actual and predicted values.Since the difference is squared, the direction of the error is meaningless and only the magnitude matters.\n28.If the loss is averaged across the entire training samples, the loss is called a cost function.\n29.Other names of Mean Squared Error are Mean Squared Deviation, Quadratic Loss, L2 Loss.\n30.The Mean Absolute Error is the mean of the sum of absolute differences between predictive values and actual values.\n31.L1 Loss is the other name of Mean Absolute Error.\n32.The similarity between Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error is direction is not considered, whereas magnitude is only considered.\n33.The Mean Percentage Error is the average of percent errors of the differences between predicted and actual values.\n34.The Mean Absolute Percentage Error is a calculation of the average of absolute percent of errors.\n35.The other name of Mean Absolute Percentage Error is Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation.\n36.The advantages of Mean Squared Error are when we plot a quadratic equation,we get a gradient descent with only one global minima,there is no local minima.It penalizes the model for making larger errors by squaring them.\n37.The disadvantage of Mean Squared Error is Outliers are not handled properly.\n38.The advantages of Mean Absolute Error is Outliers are handled better than Mean Squared Error,as it is not penalizing the model by squaring error value\n39.The disadvantage of Mean Absolute Errors will be they are computationally expensive as they use modulus operator function, they may be a local minima.\n40.The most commonly used error function for linear regression is Least Squared Error.\n41.No,Mean Squared Error cannot be negative,because it is an expected value of a non negative random variable.\n42.To minimize the error with the line,we use gradient descent.The way to descend is to take the gradient of the error function with respect to the weights. This gradient is going to point to a direction where the gradient increases the most.\n43.A loss function is a measure of how good a prediction model does in terms of being able to predict the expected outcome. If the loss is calculated for a single training example, it is called loss function.\n44.The loss function is the function that computes the distance between the current output of the algorithm and the expected output.\n45.A loss function is for a single training example. It is also sometimes called an error function. A cost function, on the other hand, is the average loss over the entire training dataset. \n46.Gradient descent is used for logistic regression.\n47.Mean Squared Error is metric used to measure error function.\n48.Binary cross entropy is commonly used loss function for binary classification problem.\n49.A loss function specifies a penalty for an incorrect estimate from a statistical model.\n50.The 0 1 loss function is non convex and discontinuous, so gradient methods cannot be applied.\n51.The function we want to minimize or maximize is called the objective function or criterion. Loss function is usually a function defined on a data point, prediction and label, and measures the penalty.\n52.Loss is used to calculate the gradients.\n53.Mean Squared Error is the most commonly used Loss function.\n54.Gini Impurity is the loss function used by decision trees.\n55.Multi class cross entropy is used in multi class classification loss.This is an extension of the binary cross entropy calculation where the losses for each class are calculated separately added as the result.\n56.Binary cross entropy is the measure of difference between probability distributions for a set of given random variables or events.\n57.The other name for Binary Cross Entropy is Log Loss.\n58.Yes Binary cross entropy and log loss are the same. Both terms are used for classification problems,whereas cross entropy is used for multi class classification and log loss is used for binary classification.\n59.Cross entropy loss increases, if the predicted probability is different from the actual label.\n60.The cost function used in Logistic Regression is Log Loss.\n61.Mean squared error is the simplest and most common loss function.\n62.It is just the square root of the mean squared error.\n63.For Linear Regression, Mean squared error is nothing but the Cost Function. Mean Squared Error is the sum of the squared differences between the prediction and true value\n64.To find the mean square error, take the observed value, subtract the predicted value and square that difference. Repeat that for all observations. Then, sum all of those squared values are divided by the number of observations. Notice that the numerator is the sum of the squared errors, which linear regression minimizes.\n65.Mean square error is convex on its input and parameters by itself. But on an arbitrary neural network, it is not always convex due to the presence of non linearities in the form of activation functions.\n66.It is a complex function of a complex variable. This integral is a special sigmoid function that occurs often in probability,statistics and partial differential equations.\n67.The inverse error function occurs in the solution of nonlinear heat and diffusion problems. It provides exact solutions when the diffusion coefficient is concentration dependent.\n68.The symbol error function was stated by Laplace, proved by Jacobi, and rediscovered by Ramanujan.\n69.Loss fucntion depends on presence of outliers,choice of machine learning algorithm, time efficiency of gradient descent, ease of finding derivatives, confidence of predictions.\n70.The types of loss functions based on classification are Log loss, Focal loss, Relative Entropy, Exponential loss, Hinge loss.\n71.The types of loss functions based on regression are Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Huber loss or Smooth Mean Absolute Error, Log cosh loss, Quantile loss.\n72.The measure of average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, considering their direction is called Mean Bias Error.\n73.Squaring the error in gradient descent, ensures that the error for each training example is positive.\n74.Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the cost function in various machine learning algorithms.\n75.The squared error is everywhere differentiable, while the absolute error is not, this makes the squared error more better, when compared to the techniques of mathematical optimization.\n76.The gradient descent algorithm takes a step in the direction of the negative gradient, in order to reduce loss as quickly as possible.\n77.Huber loss approaches Mean Absolute Error when hyperparameter delta is approximately equal to 0 and Huber loss approaches Mean Squared Error when delta is approximately equal to infinity.\n78.Quantile loss functions are useful, when predicting an interval instead of only point predictions.\n79.Binary Cross Entropy loss is the other name of Log loss.\n80.Hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers.\n81.For a given problem statement, the solution starts with a Random initialization. These initial parameters are then used to generate the predictions that is the output. Once we have the predicted values we can calculate the error or the cost.\n82.If the execution is not done properly while using gradient descent, it may lead to problems like vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problems.\n83.The goal of gradient descent is to minimize the cost function, or the error between predicted and actual output.\n84.The standard error tells you, how accurate the mean of any given sample from that population is likely to be compared to the true population mean.\n85.Calculate error between the actual value and the predicted value, Reiterate until you find the best weights of network, Pass an input through the network and get values from output layer, Initialize random weight and bias.\n86.Mini Batch gradient descent works faster than both Batch gradient descent and Stochastic gradient descent.\n87.There is no correct value for Mean squared error. Simply put, lower the value will be better and 0 means the model is perfect.\n88.The choice of error function depends entirely on how our model will be used. Example is Squared deviation.\n89.Hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers.\n90.Root Mean Squared Error is measure of the average deviation of model predictions from the actual values in the dataset.\n91.Root Mean Squared Error is a cost function, since it is square root of average of squared errors across samples in the dataset.\n92.Root Mean Squared Error value ranges from zero to infinity.\n93.The lower the Root Mean Squared Error, the better a given model is able to fit the dataset.\n94.We cannot claim any number as good Root Mean Squared Error value, since it is based upon the dependent variable.\n95.Based on a rule of thumb, it can be said that Root Mean Squared Error values between 0.2 and 0.5 shows that the model can predict the data accurately.\n96.Standard deviation is used to measure the spread of data around the mean, while Root Mean Squared Error is used to measure distance between some values and prediction for those values.\n97.Root Mean Squared Error has the same units as the quantity being estimated.\n98.Lower values of Root Mean Squared Error indicates a better fit of model on to the data.\n99.If the Root Mean Squared Error for the test set is much higher than that of the training set, it describes that you have badly over fit the data.\n100.Linear Cost Function, Quadratic Cost Function, Cubic Cost Function.\n101.when the Mean Squared loss function is plotted with respect to weights of the logistic regression model, the curve obtained is not a convex curve which makes it very difficult to find the global minimum.\n102.Cross entropy is better than Mean squared error for classification, because the decision boundary in a classification task is large in comparison with regression.\n103.The deviation of an observable value is measured by using error function.\n104.Yes loss function is same as Objective function, loss function is a part of a cost function which is a type of an objective function.\n105.The Mean Squared Error, or MSE loss is the default loss to use for regression problems. Mathematically, it is the preferred loss function under the inference framework of maximum likelihood if the distribution of the target variable is Gaussian.\n106.The exponential loss is convex and grows exponentially for negative values which makes it more sensitive to outliers. The exponential loss is used in the AdaBoost algorithm.\n107.Contrastive loss is used to map vectors that model the similarity of input items. These mappings can support many tasks, like unsupervised learning, one shot learning, and other distance metric learning tasks.\n108.If we want to indicate the uncertainty around the estimate of the mean measurement, we quote the standard error of the mean. The standard error is most useful as a means of calculating a confidence interval.\n109.The smaller the standard error, the less the spread and the more likely it is that any sample mean is close to the population mean. A small standard error is thus a Good Thing.\n110.Standard Error value of 0.8 to 0.9 are acceptable.\n111.Type 1 errors are false positives. They happen when the tester validates a statistically significant difference even though there is not one.\n112.Type II error are false negatives. A type II error is defined as the probability of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis, when in fact it is not applicable to the entire population.\n113.Type III error occurs when you get the right answer to the wrong question. Type III error occurs when you correctly conclude that the two groups are statistically different, but you are wrong about the direction of the difference.\n114.A type IV error was defined as the incorrect interpretation of a correctly rejected null hypothesis. Statistically significant interactions were classified in any of the categories such as correct interpretation or cell mean interpretation or main effect interpretation or no interpretation.\n115.Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, Type II error is probability of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis, Type III error is getting the right answer to the wrong question, Type IV error is incorrect interpretation of a correctly rejected null hypothesis.\n116.Alpha error occurs when the null hypothesis is erroneously rejected.\n117.Beta error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly retained.\n118.The other name of type I error is Alpha Error.\n119.the other name of type II error is Beta Error.\n120.The significance level of Type I Error is set as 0.05, which is 5 percentage.\n121.Type 1 errors can result from two sources such as random chance and improper research techniques.\n122.We can control the likelihood of a Type I error by changing the level of significance. The probability of a Type I error is equal to alpha, so if you want to avoid them, lower your significance level maybe from 5 percent down to 1 percent.\n123.The significance level, also denoted as alpha, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, a significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5 percent risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.\n124.Type II errors can be avoided by increasing the sample size, increasing the significance level.\n125.To decide worst type of error, errors depends upon situation, in some cases, a Type I error is preferable to a Type II error, but in other applications, a Type I error is more dangerous to make than a Type II error.\n126.There are two types of statistical errors such as Sampling error and Non sampling error.\n127.Bias is the amount that a model prediction differs from the target value, compared to the training data. Bias error results from simplifying the assumptions used in a model so the target functions are easier to approximate.\n128.The other names of Bias Error are Error due, Squared Bias.\n129.To calculate the bias of a method used for many estimates, find the errors by subtracting each estimate from the actual or observed value. Add up all the errors and divide by the number of estimates to get the bias.\n130.Random error is a chance difference between the observed and true values of something. For example, a researcher misreading a weighing scale records an incorrect measurement.\n131.If you measure a sample from a wider population, then the average or mean of the sample will be an approximation of the population mean. Thus 68 percent of all sample means will be within one standard error of the population mean and 95 percent within two standard errors.\n132.High Bias can be solved by adding more features to the hypothesis function, if new features are not available, we create new features by combining two or more existing features or by taking a square, cube, etc of the existing feature.\n133.If the experimental value is less than the accepted value, the error is negative. \n134.Error variance is the statistical variability of scores caused by the influence of variables other than the independent variable.\n135.The standard error is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of sample size.\n136.Standard error and standard deviation are both measures of variability. The standard deviation reflects variability within a sample, while the standard error estimates the variability across samples of a population.\n137.Sampling error is the difference in size between a sample estimate and the population parameter. The standard error of the mean, sometimes shortened to standard error, provided a measure of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the population parameter.\n138.When the standard error is large relative to the statistic, the statistic will typically be non significant. However, if the sample size is very large, for example, sample sizes greater than 1000, then virtually any statistical result calculated on that sample will be statistically significant.\n139.Standard error is used to estimate the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of a sample\n140.The sampling error is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the population by the square root of the size of the sample, and then multiplying the resultant with the Z score value, which is based on the confidence interval.\n141.Sampling errors may be positive or negative.\n142.The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. It is therefore the square root of the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean. \n143.Margin of error can be calculated by multiplying critical value with standard deviation of population or sample.\n144.Standard deviation is an essential part of calculating the margin of error for your data. If you do not have the value for your sample data proportion, you can use standard deviation to determine the margin of error.\n145.Uncertainty is measured with a variance or its square root, which is a standard deviation. The standard deviation of a statistic is also called standard error. Uncertainty emerges because of variability.\n146.The sampling errors can be eliminated by increasing the sample size or the number of samples.\n147.Sampling error is the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic used to estimate it. For example, the difference between a population mean and a sample mean is sampling error.\n148.Non sampling error refers to all sources of error that are unrelated to sampling. Non sampling errors are present in all types of survey, including censuses and administrative data.\n149.Sampling error is affected by a number of factors including sample size, sample design, the sampling fraction and the variability within the population.\n150.In general, larger sample sizes decrease the sampling error, however this decrease is not directly proportional.\n151.Sampling error is a statistical error happens due to the sample selected does not perfectly represents the population of interest. Non sampling error occurs due to sources other than sampling, while conducting survey activities is known as non sampling error.\n152.Nonsampling errors, arise mainly due to misleading definitions and concepts, inadequate frames, unsatisfactory questionnaires, defective methods of data collection, tabulation, coding, incomplete coverage of sample units.\n153.Techniques to avoid non sampling error are randomizing the selection, training your team, performing external record checks, completing consistency checks, checking your wording, randomizing question order and sticking to the facts.\n154.Undercoverage occurs when the sampling frame does not include all members of the target population\n155.Coverage error, Measurement error, Nonresponse error and Processing error.\n156.Sampling errors can be reduced by increasing sample size, splitting population into smaller groups and by using random sampling.\n157.Yes, the Standard error could be greater than its mean and this might indicates high variation between values and abnormal distribution for data. in such case, it is advisable to use median and range instead of Mean and standard deviation to describe your data.\n158.Generally, sampling error is the difference in size between a sample estimate and the population parameter. The standard error of the mean, sometimes shortened to standard error, provided a measure of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the population parameter.\n159.Sampling error is important in creating estimates of the population value of a particular variable, how much these estimates can be expected to vary across samples, and the level of confidence that can be placed in the results.\n160.Non response errors result from a failure to collect complete information on all units in the selected sample.\n161.The risk of sampling error is, they may create distortions in the results, leading users to draw incorrect conclusions.\n162.The risk of sampling errors can be prevented, if the analysts select subsets or samples of data to represent the whole population effectively.\n163.Total and Partial are 2 types of non response errors.\n164.Total nonresponse error occurs when all or almost all data for a sampling unit are missing.\n165.Partial nonresponse error occurs when respondents provide incomplete information.\n166.Response errors represent a lack of accuracy in responses to questions.\n167.They different factors of response error are, including a questionnaire that requires improvements, misinterpretation of questions by interviewers or respondents, and errors in respondent statements.\n168.The ways to control response errors include using aided recall, replacing open questions with specific questions, using more appropriate time periods, employing bounded recall and records, using diaries, etc.\n169.False positive error and False negative error are two types of selection errors.\n170.unit non response error and item non response error are two categories of non response errors.\n171.Magnet loss is a type of loss function used in distance metric learning of machine learning problems.\n172.Chance Error or chance Variation is the other name of random error.\n173.Chance variation or chance error or random error is the inherent error in any predictive statistical model.\n174.The Absolute error is the difference between the measured value and the actual value. Relative error is the ratio of the absolute error of the measurement to the accepted measurement.\n175.Huber loss is a smooth approximation to absolute value.\n176.Huber loss is more robust to outliers than Mean Squared Error.\n177.Yes, Huber loss function is convex.\n178.The statistician Peter Huber invented Huber loss.\n179.Smooth L1 loss can be interpreted as a combination of L1 loss and L2 loss. It behaves as L1 loss when the absolute value of the argument is high, and it behaves like L2 loss when the absolute value of the argument is close to zero.\n180.The logistic loss is convex and grows linearly for negative values which make it less sensitive to outliers. The logistic loss is used in the LogitBoost algorithm.\n181.We should always use a convex loss function so that gradient descent can converge to the global minima.\n182.In multilabel classification, the zero one loss function corresponds to the subset zero one loss, for each sample the entire set of labels must be correctly predicted, otherwise the loss for that sample is equal to one.\n183.The logarithm of sigmoid function is not convex.\n184.The quadratic loss function gives a measure of how accurate a predictive model is. It works by taking the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value, so it is used on classification schemes which produce probabilities\n185.Naive Bayes classifier is an example of quadratic loss function\n186.Squared Hinge loss is an extension of the hinge loss and it is the square of the hinge loss function.\n187.Gini Impurity is a measure of the likelihood that an instance of a random variable is incorrectly classified per the classes in the data provided the classification is random.\n188.Hellinger Distance is a cost function that satisfies the triangle inequality.\n189.The Hellinger distance forms a bounded metric on the space of probability distributions over a given probability space.\n190.Yes Hellinger distance is symmetric. The Hellinger distance metric gives an output in the range of 0 to 1 for two probability distributions, with values closer to 0 meaning they are more similar. \n191.Hinge loss function typically works best when the values of the output variable are in the set of minus 1 to plus 1.\n192.Squared Hinge loss is perfectly suitable for Yes or No type of questions, where the deviation in probability is not a concern.\n193.The lower bound for Gini impurity function is 0\n194.The other name of cross entropy loss function is logarithmic loss.\n195.The weighted Cross Entropy loss function is used to solve the problem that the accuracy of the deep learning model overfitting on the test set due to the imbalance of the convergence speed of the loss function decreases.\n196.Mathematically, if your label is 1 and your predicted probability is low like 0.1, the cross entropy can be greater than 1, like losses\n197.The weighted loss function  is calculated based on the predicted value and error obtained for each instance. This method is applicable to both prognostic and diagnostic tasks.\n198.Categorical cross entropy is a loss function that is used in multi cass classification tasks. These are tasks where an example can only belong to one out of many possible categories and the model must decide which one.\n199.Zero entropy means perfect knowledge of a state, no motion, no temperature, no uncertainty. \n200.For logistic regression, this cross entropy loss function is conveniently convex. A convex function has just one minimum, there are no local minima, so gradient descent starting from any point is guaranteed to find the minimum.\nans1. ordinal regression also called ordinal classification is a type of regression analysis used for predicting an ordinal variable that is a variable whose value exists on an arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different values is significant.\n\nans2. Bayesian non parametric ordinal regression under a monotonicity constraint Herein the considered models are non parametric and the only condition imposed is that the effects of the covariates on the outcome categories are stochastically monotone according to the ordinal scale.\n\nans3. The assumptions for Ordinal Logistic Regression include Linearity, No Outliers, Independence.\n\nans4. Ordinal data is a kind of categorical data with a set order or scale to it For example ordinal data is said to have been collected when a responder inputs his or her financial happiness level on a scale of 1 10.\n\nans5. To find out relationship between ordinal variables, you can use Spearman rank correlation or Kendalls Tau c In the same way for graphical representation you can use multiple bar chart. check whether there is a positive or negative relationship between two variable.\n\nans6. Assumptions The dependent variable is measured on an ordinal level One or more of the independent variables are either continious categorical or ordinal No Multi collinearity  that is when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other.\n\nans7. Interpret the key results for Binary Logistic Regression\nStep 1 Determine whether the association between the response and the term is statistically significant.\nStep 2 Understand the effects of the predictors.\nStep 3 Determine how well the model fits your data.\nStep 4 Determine whether the model does not fit the data.\n\nans8. The logistic regression coefficient beta associated with a predictor X is the expected change in log odds of having the outcome per unit change in X.\n\nans9. R squared is a goodness of fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively.\n\nans10.The package scikit learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. Like NumPy, scikit learn is also open source.\n\nans11.At a very high level, the main difference ordinal regression and linear regression is that with linear regression the dependent variable is continuous and ordinal the dependent variable is ordinal.\n\nans12.Logistic regression is usually taken to mean binary logistic regression for a two valued dependent variable Y. Ordinal regression is a general term for any model dedicated to ordinal Y whether Y is discrete or continuous.\n\nans13.The best model was deemed to be the linear model, because it has the highest AIC, and a fairly low R square adjusted in fact, it is within 1 percent of that of model poly31 which has the highest R square adjusted\n\nans14. In ordinal regression analysis, the dependent variable is ordinal statistically it is polytomous ordinal and the independent variables are ordinal or continuous level ratio or interval. Sometimes the dependent variable is also called response, endogenous variable, prognostic variable or regressand.\n\nans15.An ordinal superiority measure summarizes the probability that an observation from one distribution falls above an independent observation from the other distribution, adjusted for explanatory variables in a model.\n\nans16.Nominal data is classified without a natural order or rank, whereas ordinal data has a predetermined or natural order.On the other hand, numerical or quantitative data will always be a number that can be measured\n\nans17.The Ordinal scale includes statistical data type where variables are in order or rank but without a degree of difference between categories. The ordinal scale contains qualitative data ordinal meaning order. It places variables in order or rank, only permitting to measure the value as higher or lower in scale.\n\nans18.The simplest way to analyze ordinal data is to use visualization tools. For instance, the data may be presented in a table in which each row indicates a distinct category. In addition, they can also be visualized using various charts. The most commonly used chart for representing such types of data is the bar chart.\n\nans19.Age can be both nominal and ordinal data depending on the question types. I.e How old are you is used to collect nominal data while Are you the firstborn or What position are you in your family is used to collect ordinal data. Age becomes ordinal data when there some sort of order to it.\n\nans20.Linear Regression is used to handle regression problems whereas Logistic regression is used to handle the classification problems. Linear regression provides a continuous output but Logistic regression provides discreet output\n\nans21.Both multinomial and ordinal models are used for categorical outcomes with more than two categories. The simplest decision criterion is whether that outcome is nominali.e., no ordering to the categories or ordinal i.e., the categories have an order.\n\nans22.The ordinal data is qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position. These kinds of data can be considered as in between the qualitative data and quantitative data. The ordinal data only shows the sequences and cannot use for statistical analysis\n\nans23.Ordinal regression is used to predict the dependent variable with ordered multiple categories and independent variables. In other words, it is used to facilitate the interaction of dependent variables having multiple ordered levels with one or more independent variables\n\nans24.Ordinal scale is the 2nd level of measurement that reports the ranking and ordering of the data without actually establishing the degree of variation between them. Ordinal level of measurement is the second of the four measurement scales. Ordinal indicates order\n\nans25.Examples of ordinal variables include socio economic status low income,middle income,high income, education level high school,BS,MS,PhD, income level less than 50K, 50K to 100K, over 100K, satisfaction rating extremely dislike, dislike, neutral, like, extremely like\n\nans26.Ordinal refers to quantities that have a natural ordering.Interval data is like ordinal except we can say the intervals between each value are equally split. The most common example is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nans27.Ordinal scale has all its variables in a specific order, beyond just naming them. Ratio scale bears all the characteristics of an interval scale, in addition to that, it can also accommodate the value of zero on any of its variables.\n\nans28.The mean cannot be computed with ordinal data. Finding the mean requires you to perform arithmetic operations like addition and division on the values in the data set. Since the differences between adjacent scores are unknown with ordinal data, these operations cannot be performed for meaningful results.\n\nans29.Values on 5 point ordinal scales are never normally distributed\n\nans30.If the variable is ordinal, the median is probably your best bet because it provides more information about the sample than the mode does. But if the variable is interval or ratio, you will need to determine if the distribution is symmetrical or skewed.\n\nans31.A stronger reason for not using the mean with ordinal data is that its value depends on conventions on coding. Numerical codes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 are usually just chosen for simplicity or convenience, but in principle they could equally well be 1, 23, 456, 7890 as far as corresponding to a defined order as concerned.\n\nans32.Now you can usually use linear regression with an ordinal dependent variable but you will see that the diagnostic plots do not look good.\n\nans33.The ordinal data is qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position. These kinds of data can be considered as in between the qualitative data and quantitative data. The ordinal data only shows the sequences and cannot use for statistical analysis\n\nans34.An ordinal variable is similar to a categorical variable. The difference between the two is that there is a clear ordering of the categories. For example, suppose you have a variable, economic status, with three categories low, medium and high.\n\nans35.Religion. There are many different religions, but again these are just different ways of categorizing the religious preferences of people. Consequently religion has only a nominal scale of measurement\n\nans36.Ordinal data is frequently skewed or multi modal so violates the assumption of normal distribution. Thus the distribution is not appropriate for analysis as metric data\n\nans37.If a variable is ordinal and has at least five categories, making a normality assumption can work well, and then it can make sense to check normality.To check normality, compute skewness or kurtosis. Do not rely on significance tests for normality, because these are strongly sample size dependent\n\nans38.The mode is most useful when used with categorical nominal, or ordinal variables and when there is a relatively small sample size. The mode can be used with categorical variables because it does not require the data to be in a meaningful order. With large samples, it becomes very tedious to determine the mode.\n\nans39.The median is usually preferred to other measures of central tendency when your data set is skewed i.e., forms a skewed distribution or you are dealing with ordinal data. However, the mode can also be appropriate in these situations, but is not as commonly used as the median.\n\nans40.Although a t test or ANOVA will work with ordinal data, such an analysis is incorrect because there is no information on the distance between measurements, only their order. Fortunately, easy to use freeware is available for nonparametric analyses of ordinal data to draw robust conclusions.\n\nans41.The most suitable statistical tests for ordinal data e.g. Likert scale are non parametric tests, such as Mann Whitney U test one variable, no assumption on distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test two variables, normal distribution, Kruskal Wallis test two or more groups, no assumption on distribution.\n\nans42.The ordinal data is qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position. These kinds of data can be considered as in between the qualitative data and quantitative data. The ordinal data only shows the sequences and cannot use for statistical analysis\n\nans43.Ordinal regression is used to predict the dependent variable with ordered multiple categories and independent variables. In other words, it is used to facilitate the interaction of dependent variables having multiple ordered levels with one or more independent variables. For example Let us assume a survey is done.\n\nans44.The standard approach to ordinal classification converts the class value into a numeric quantity and applies a regression learner to the transformed data, translating the output back into a discrete class value in a post processing step.\n\nans45.First, identify your thresholds estimates. You will have one for each possible increase in the outcome variable. For example, if your outcome has a low, medium, and high category, you have two thresholds.one is for the increase from low to medium, and one is for the increase from medium to high.\n\nans46.In ordinal regression analysis, the dependent variable is ordinal statistically it is polytomous ordinal and the independent variables are ordinal or continuous level ratio or interval. Sometimes the dependent variable is also called response, endogenous variable, prognostic variable or regressand.\n\nans47.The most appropriate statistical tests for ordinal data focus on the rankings of your measurements. These are non parametric tests. Parametric tests are used when your data fulfils certain criteria, like a normal distribution. While parametric tests assess means, non parametric tests often assess medians or ranks.\n\nans48.Ordinal data can be visualized in several different ways. Common visualizations are the bar chart or a pie chart. Tables can also be useful for displaying ordinal data and frequencies. Mosaic plots can be used to show the relationship between an ordinal variable and a nominal or ordinal variable.\n\nans49.Actually, it is not appropriate to treat ordinal data as if it were continuous interval data.\n\nans50.Ordinal numbers tell the order of how things are set, they show the position or the rank of something.\n\nans51.Treat ordinal variables as numeric\n\nBecause the ordering of the categories often is central to the research question, many data analysts do the opposite ignore the fact that the ordinal variable really is not numerical and treat the numerals that designate each category as actual numbers.\n\nans52.No. The pairs of ordinal numbers 1 and 4 and, 2 and 3 both sum to 5.\n\nans53.The purpose of using ordinal numbers is to indicate position, or order of things or objects.Since the counting process requires labeling of things with numbering, when objects or things are placed in an order, ordinal numbers tell their exact position, or they help to put things in an order in a collection.\n\nans54.Ordinal numbers can be written out as words second, third or as numerals followed by abbreviations 2nd,3rd\n\nans55.one to first.\ntwo to second.\nthree to third.\nfive to fifth.\neight to eighth.\nnine to ninth.\ntwelve to twelfth\n\nans56.An ordinal scale is a scale of measurement that uses labels to classify cases measurements into ordered classes.Some examples of variables that use ordinal scales would be movie ratings, political affiliation, military rank, etc. Example. One example of an ordinal scale could be movie ratings.\n\n\nans57.The assumptions of the Chi square include The data in the cells should be frequencies, or counts of cases rather than percentages or some other transformation of the data.However, data may be ordinal data. Interval or ratio data that have been collapsed into ordinal categories may also be used.\n\nans58.The most suitable statistical tests for ordinal data e.g., Likert scale are non parametric tests, such as Mann Whitney U test one variable, no assumption on distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test two variables, normal distribution, Kruskal Wallis test two or more groups, no assumption on distribution.\n\nans59.A stronger reason for not using the mean with ordinal data is that its value depends on conventions on coding. Numerical codes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 are usually just chosen for simplicity or convenience, but in principle they could equally well be 1, 23, 456, 7890 as far as corresponding to a defined order as concerned.\n\nans60.An ordinal variable is a categorical variable for which the possible values are ordered. Ordinal variables can be considered in between categorical and quantitative variables. Thus it does not make sense to take a mean of the values\n\nans61.The Ordinal scale includes statistical data type where variables are in order or rank but without a degree of difference between categories. The ordinal scale contains qualitative data ordinal meaning order. It places variables in order or rank, only permitting to measure the value as higher or lower in scale.\n\nans62.Military ranks can be considered ordinal measurements. A General is greater in military rank than a Captain who is greater in rank than a Sergeant. Moh's scale of hardness is another good example of measurement at the ordinal level.\n\nans63.Specify a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100.\n\nans64.All continuous data has a median, mode and mean. However, strictly speaking, ordinal data has a median and mode only, and nominal data has only a mode.\n\nans65.In some cases, the measurement scale for data is ordinal, but the variable is treated as continuous. For example, a Likert scale that contains five values strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree is ordinal.\n\nans66.ORCA Ordinal Regression and Classification Algorithms is an Octave/MATLAB framework including a wide set of ordinal regression methods.\n\nans67.The best model was deemed to be the linear model, because it has the highest AIC, and a fairly low R square adjusted in fact, it is within 1 percent of that of model poly31 which has the highest R square adjusted.\n\nans68.Ordinal regression seeks class label predictions when the penalty incurred for mistakes increases according to an ordering over the labels.The absolute error, between label prediction  and actual label is a canonical ordinal regression loss function.\n\nans69.To perform ordinal regression, we need to expand the targets list into a batch size, num labels tensor, according to our previous encoding, and return the mean squared error loss between predictions and the expanded target Code for the loss function, which first encodes the target label and then calculates MSE\n\nans70.Likert scales fall within the ordinal level of measurement the categories of response have directionality, but the intervals between them cannot be presumed equal.\n\nans71.In ordinal encoding, each unique category value is assigned an integer value.\n\nFor example, red is 1, green is 2, and blue is 3.\n\nThis is called an ordinal encoding or an integer encoding and is easily reversible. Often, integer values starting at zero are used.\n\nans72.Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent target and independent variable s predictor. This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, relationship between rash driving and number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression.\n\nans73. regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Lets understand this with an easy example\n\nLets say, you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the recent company data which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy. Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current and past information.\n\nans74.Linear Regression\nLogistic Regression\nPolynomial Regression\nStepwise Regression\nRidge Regression\nLasso Regression\nElasticNet Regression\n\nans75.Life is usually simple, when you know only one or two techniques. One of the training institutes I know of tells their students  if the outcome is continuous apply linear regression. If it is binary  use logistic regression However, higher the number of options available at our disposal, more difficult it becomes to choose the right one. A similar case happens with regression models.\n\nans76.For better predictions, categorical variable can be considered as a continuous variable only when the variable is ordinal in nature.\n\nans77.An odds ratio in an ordinal response model is interpreted the same as in a binary model it gives the change in odds for a unit increase in a continuous predictor or when changing levels of a categorical CLASS predictor\n\n\nans78.Logistic regression fits a logistic curve to binary data. This logistic curve can be interpreted as the probability associated with each outcome across independent variable values. Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between the natural log of these probabilities when expressed as odds and your predictor variable is linear.\n\nans79.You want to use one variable in a prediction of another, or you want to quantify the numerical relationship between two variables\nThe variable you want to predict your dependent variable is an ordered categorical ordinal variable\n\n\nans80.SPSS ordinal regression procedure works with the data, because it differs from logistic regression. First, for the dependent outcome variable, SPSS actually models the probability of achieving each level or below rather than each level or above\n\nans81.Ordinal variables have at least three categories and the categories have a natural order. The categories are ranked but the differences between ranks may not be equal. For example, first, second, and third in a race are ordinal data\n\nans82.This means that if your data contains categorical data, you must encode it to numbers before you can fit and evaluate a model. The two most popular techniques are an Ordinal Encoding and a One Hot Encoding\n\nans83.Ordinal variables are fundamentally categorical. One simple option is to ignore the order in the variables categories and treat it as nominal\n\nans84.Binary Encoding\n\nIn this encoding scheme, the categorical feature is first converted into numerical using an ordinal encoder. Then the numbers are transformed in the binary number. After that binary value is split into different columns. Binary encoding works really well when there are a high number of categories.\n\nans85.An ordinal variable is similar to a categorical variable. The difference between the two is that there is a clear ordering of the categories.Even though we can order these from lowest to highest, the spacing between the values may not be the same across the levels of the variables.\n\nans86.Encoding of categorical variables with high cardinality\nLabel Encoding scikit learn i.e. mapping integers to classes.\nOne Hot  Dummy Encoding scikit learn i.e. expanding the categorical feature into lots of dummy columns taking values in 0,1\n\nans87.You can put them on a scale with respect to some other, dependent, variable. So there is no correlation with ordinal variables or nominal variables because correlation is a measure of association between scale variables\n\nans88.In some cases, the measurement scale for data is ordinal, but the variable is treated as continuous. For example, a Likert scale that contains five values strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree is ordinal.\n\n\nand89.developed by Eibe Frank and Mark Hal.\n\nans90.Ordinal Numbers are those numerals which are used in identifying the position of objects or persons. They are also called as positioning numbers.The ordinal numbers can be written using numerals as prefix and adjectives as a suffix, for example, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and so on.\n\nans91.Ordinal classification is a form of multiclass classification for which there is an inherent order between the classes, but not a meaningful numeric difference between them. The performance of such classifiers is usually assessed by measures appropriate for nominal classes or for regression.\n\nans92.Ordinal logistic regression often just called ordinal regression is used to predict an ordinal dependent variable given one or more independent variables.As with other types of regression, ordinal regression can also use interactions between independent variables to predict the dependent variable.\n\nans93.Ordinal variables have two are more categories that can be ordered or ranked. Keep in mind that researchers may sometimes treat ordinal variables as continuous if they have more than five categories. To remember this variable type, think ordinal order.\n\nans94.Dichotomous variables those with only two values are a special case, and may sometimes be treated as nominal, ordinal, or interval.Whether it is better to treat a dichotomous variable as nominal or ordinal depends on how we think of the underlying concept being measured\n\nans95.Binary data is discrete data that can be in only one of two categories  either yes or no, 1 or 0, off or on, etc. Binary can be thought of as a special case of ordinal, nominal, count, or interval data.\n\nans96.An ordinal encoding involves mapping each unique label to an integer value. This type of encoding is really only appropriate if there is a known relationship between the categories. This relationship does exist for some of the variables in our dataset, and ideally, this should be harnessed when preparing the data.\n\nans97.Depending on what you want to model, hours and many other attributes like seasons are actually ordinal cyclic variables. In case of seasons you can consider them to be more or less categorical, and in case of hours you can model them as continuous as well.\n\n\nans98.Ordinal responses include Likert scales for agreement with attitude statements e.g., disagree, neither agree nor disagree, and agree and reported frequencies of doing something such as helping children with homework e.g., daily, several times per week, occasionally, and never.\n\nans99.Von Neumann definition of ordinals\n\nans100.The empty set  is an ordinal and as ordinal is denoted by 0\n101 ans the explanatory variables\n102 ans Simple linear regression is a technique that is appropriate \n          to understand the association between one independent\n          variable and one continuous dependent\n103 ans They let me to check and rethink the paradox of significant interactions \n          between the log odds model and the probability on dependent variable\n104 ans The odds for each explanatory variable must be the same\n105 ans Ordinal outcomes are polytomous or multilevel outcomes whose levels can be ordered by for example their clinical significance\n106 ans It is currently not possible to change the reference category in the Ordinal Regression module\n107 ans A statistically significant result isnt attributed to chance and depends on two key variables sample size and effect size\n108 ans If this assumption is violated we cannot reduce the coefficients of the model to a single set across all outcome categories and this modeling approach fails\n109 ans It could be argued that it is easier to split ordinal outcome variables down in to multiple binary variables and model the data using a series of logistic regression analyses rather than a single ordinal regression analysis\n110 ans Ordinal regression is a general term for any model dedicated to ordinal Y whether Y is discrete or continuous\n111 ans the test of the P assumption has been described as anti conservative that is it nearly always results in rejection of the proportional odds assumption particularly when the number of explanatory variables is large\n112 ans Linear regression and logistic regression are two types of regression analysis\n113 ans Ordinal logistic regression often just called ordinal regression is used to predict an ordinal dependent variable given one or more independent variables\n114 ans the two groups deteriorate at about the same rate hence the difference between groups is about the same across occasions\n115 ans Ordinal regression is a member of the family of regression analyses as a predictive analysis\n116 ans All continuous data has a median mode and mean However strictly speaking ordinal data has a median and mode only and nominal data has only a mode\n117 ans Ordinal regression is a statistical technique that is used to predict behavior of ordinal level dependent variables\n118 ans Ordinal regression is a statistical technique that is used to predict behavior of ordinal level dependent variables with a set of independent variables\n119 ans Ordinal Scale is defined as a variable measurement scale used to simply depict the order of variables and not the difference between each of the variables\n120 ans Nominal scale is a naming scale where variables are simply named or labeled with no specific order\n121 ans In statistics ordinal and nominal variables are both considered categorical variables Even though ordinal data can sometimes be numerical not all mathematical operations can be performed on them\n122 ans Scales of measurement is how variables are defined and categorised\n123 ans A parallel slopes model is the result of a multiple linear regression model that has both one numeric explanatory variable and one categorical explanatory variable\n124 ans Cross tabulation also known as cross tab or contingency table is a statistical tool used for categorical data\n125 ans A significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5 percentage risk of concluding that an association exists when there is no actual association\n126 ans R squared R2 is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable thats explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model\n127 ans Now let us start this ordinal regression analysis click analyze in this regression and in this ordinal Now dependent variable is satisfaction And independent variable is factor\n128 ans Model fitting is a measure of how well a machine learning model generalizes to similar data to that on which it was trained\n129 ans If the slope of the line is positive then there is a positive linear relationship i.e as one increases the other increases\n130 ans A link function transforms the probabilities of the levels of a categorical response variable to a continuous scale that is unbounded\n131 ans In its most general sense Covariates are simply the X variables in a statistical model and An interaction model is a design model that binds an application together in a way that supports the conceptual models of its target users\n132 ans The parallel trend assumption is the most critical of the above the four assumptions to ensure internal validity of DID models\n133 ans This issue is more common with binary outcomes but given that ordinal regression is an extension of logistic regression it is plausible to see it occur here as well The problem is likely a result of empty cells for a given outcome level conditional on the covariates\n134 ans Regression predictions are for the mean of the dependent variable\n135 ans So more generally this indicates that a scores increase on an independent variable Theres an increased probability of falling at a higher level on the dependent\n136 ans In SPSS Statistics an ordinal regression can be carried out using one of two procedures PLUM and GENLIN Whilst GENLIN has a number of advantages over PLUM including being easier and quicker to carry out it is only available if you have SPSS Statistics Advanced Module\n137 ans Ordinal scale is the 2nd level of measurement that reports the ranking and ordering of the data without actually establishing the degree of variation between them\n138 ans Multicollinearity occurs when you have two or more independent variables that are highly correlated with each other\n139 ans The Output Management System OMS provides the ability to automatically write selected categories of output to different output files in different formats\n140 ans Ordinal Regression allows you to model the dependence of a polytomous ordinal response on a set of predictors which can be factors or covariates The design of Ordinal Regression is based on the methodology of McCullagh 1980 1998 and the procedure is referred to as PLUM in the syntax\n141 ans The Parameter estimates table is the core of the output telling us specifically about the relationship between our explanatory variables and the outcome\n142 ans These tests include an ordinal\n        version of the Hosmer Lemeshow test the Pulkstenis Robinson chi squared and\n        deviance tests and the Lipsitz likelihood ratio test\n143 ans Like all IRT models it is seeking to predict the probability of a certain response based on examinee ability trait level and some parameters which describe the performance of the item With the 3PL those parameters are a discrimination b difficulty or location and c pseudo guessing\n144 ans So the Hosmer lemma so test the way it works is it divides the data set into a number of groups according to the fitted probabilities that the binary outcome is a 1 And then it compares\n145 ans In other words falls in assigned score when the latent variable falls in the th interval of values\n146 ans Analyzing the Homogeneity of a Dataset\n        Calculate the median\n        Subtract the median from each value in the dataset\n        Count how many times the data will make a run above or below the median i.e persistance of positive or negative values\n        Use significance tables to determine thresholds for homogeneity\n147 ans The probability that a particular Chi Square test statistic is as extreme

The ordered probit and logit models have a dependent variable that are ordered categories Examples include rating systems poor fair good excellent opinion surveys from strongly disagree to strongly agree grades and bond ratings\n150 ans Regression coefficients are estimates of the unknown population parameters and describe the relationship between a predictor variable and the response In linear regression coefficients are the values that multiply the predictor values\n151 ans Logistic regression is a powerful machine learning algorithm that utilizes a sigmoid function and works best on binary classification problems although it can be used on multi class classification problems through the one vs all method\n152 ans We implement the trick described above by creating OrdinalClassifier class that will train k minus 1 binary classifier when fit is called and will return predicted class if predict is called\n153 ans We can take advantage of the ordered class value by transforming a k class\n154 ans to get predicted probability of each class first we get all prediction probability from all of our classifiers that stored on clfs after that simply enumerate all possible class label and append its prediction to our predicted list after that return it as a numpy array\n155 ans\twe store each unique label available then for first k minus 1 value for each iteration we transform its label to a binary label that represents the test A multiply Vi binary y equal to y greater than self.unique class i.astypenp.uint8 then we fit a new classifier on the

supervised classification algorithm\n165 ans Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome such as yes or no based on prior observations of a data set Based on historical data about earlier outcomes involving the same input criteria it then scores new cases on their probability of falling into one of two outcome categories\n166 ans Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value\n167 ans Logistic regression and more generally GLM does NOT belong to Machine Learning Rather these methods belongs to parametric modeling Both parametric and algorithmic ML models use the data but in different ways\n168 ans Logistic regression is used for binary or multi class classification and the target variable always has to be categorical\n169 ans Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome such as yes or no based on prior observations of a data set A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables\n170 ans Logistic regression is easier to implement interpret and very efficient to train If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfitting It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space\n171 ans A neural network is more complex than logistic regression In practice a neural network model for binary classification can be worse than a logistic regression model because neural networks are more difficult to train and are more prone to overfitting than logistic regression\n172 ans logistic regression cannot be used for classification tasks that have more than two class labels so called multi class classification A logistic regression model that is adapted to learn and predict a multinomial probability distribution is referred to as Multinomial Logistic Regression\n173 ans With chi square contingency analysis the independent variable is dichotomous and the dependent variable is dichotomous Logistic regression is a more general analysis however because the independent variable i.e the predictor is not restricted to a dichotomous variable\n174 ans Originally a perceptron was only referring to neural networks with a step function as the transfer function In that case of course the difference is that the logistic regression uses a logistic function and the perceptron uses a step function\n175 ans The p value for each term tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero no effect\n176 ans Logistic regression LR is a statistical method similar to linear regression since LR finds an equation that predicts an outcome for a binary variable Y from one or more response variables X\n177 ans The most common form of error for logistic regression perceptron and support vector models is mean squared error\n178 ans The output from the logistic regression analysis gives a p value of which is based on the Wald z score\n179 ans Logistic regression has two phases training we train the system specifically the weights w and b using stochastic gradient descent and the cross entropy loss\n180 ans An F statistic of at least 3.95 is needed to reject the null hypothesis at an alpha level of 0.1\n181 ans Like other regression techniques logistic regression involves the use of two hypotheses\n182 ans Lets start by defining the logistic regression cost function for the two points of interest y equal to 1 and y equal to 0 that is when the hypothesis function predicts Male or Female\n183 ans Odds ratios are one of those concepts in statistics that are just really hard to wrap your head around For example, in logistic regression the odds ratio represents the constant effect of a predictor X on the likelihood that one outcome will occur\n184 ans The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables\n185 ans SVM works well with unstructured and semi structured data like text and images while logistic regression works with already identified independent variables\n186 ans Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm as it converts the values of the log of odds which can range from  minus inf to plus inf to a range between 0 and 1 Since logistic functions output the probability of occurrence of an event they can be applied to many real life scenarios therefore these models are very popular\n187 ans Analysis of Variance ANOVA is a statistical analysis to test the degree of differences between two or more groups of an experiment\n188 ans Probability is the probability an event happens For example there might be an 80 percentage chance of rain today Odds more technically the odds of success is defined as probability of success or probability of failure Log odds is the logarithm of the odds\n189 ans True Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm because it uses true labels for training Supervised learning algorithm should have input variables x and an target variable Y when you train the model \n190 ans denotes the corresponding value but for the null model the model with only an intercept and no covariates\n191 ans Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used when the target variable is categorical\n192 ans Summary We need to perform Feature Scaling when we are dealing with Gradient Descent Based algorithms Linear and Logistic Regression Neural Network and Distance based algorithms KNN K means SVM as these are very sensitive to the range of the data points\n193 ans Parameter estimates also called coefficients are the log odds ratio associated with a one unit change of the predictor all other predictors being held constant The unknown model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation\n194 ans Variables that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the model fitting model learned function and might end up creating a bias Thus to deal with this potential problem feature wise normalization such as MinMax Scaling is usually used prior to model fitting\n195 ans In regression analysis you need to standardize the independent variables when your model contains polynomial terms to model curvature or interaction terms\n196 ans In 1944 Joseph Berkson used log of odds and called this function logit abbreviation for logistic unit following the analogy for probit\n197 ans One of the way to improve accuracy for logistic regression models is by optimising the prediction probability cutoff scores generated by your logit model\n198 ans Penalized logistic regression imposes a penalty to the logistic model for having too many variables\n199 ans The z score enables a data administrator to compare two different scores that are from different normal distributions of the data\n200 ans Yes you do need to scale the target variable I will quote this reference A target variable with a large spread of values in turn may result in large error gradient values causing weight values to change dramatically making the learning process unstable",
